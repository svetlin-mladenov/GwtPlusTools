"THE CAFFEINE-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 2):
<svetlin.mladenov@gmail.com> wrote this code.  As long as you retain this notice you
can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a caffeine-containing
drink (like a cup of coffee or black tea) in return.   Svetlin Mladenov
